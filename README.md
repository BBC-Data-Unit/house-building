In August 2018 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-45050276) house-building across half of England was slower than it had been before the financial crash.

Our analysis revealed almost a decade on from the 2008 crisis, some 52% of councils saw fewer homes built in the past year than in the year leading up to the crisis.

80% of council areas (267 out of 333 with comparable data) saw fewer homes built annually than the government estimated they needed.
