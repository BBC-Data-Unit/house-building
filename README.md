In August 2018 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-45050276) house-building across half of England was slower than it had been before the financial crash.

Our analysis revealed almost a decade on from the 2008 crisis, some 52% of councils saw fewer homes built in the past year than in the year leading up to the crisis.

80% of council areas (267 out of 333 with comparable data) saw fewer homes built annually than the government estimated they needed.

The Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association. Stories generated by the partnership included:
